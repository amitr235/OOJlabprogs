//Create a package CIE which has two classes- Student and Internals. The
//class Personal has members like usn, name, sem. The class Internals has an
//array that stores the internal marks scored in five courses of the current
//semester of the student. Create another package SEE which has the class
//External which is a derived class of Student. This class has an array that
//stores the SEE marks scored in five courses of the current semester of the student. 
//Import the two packages in a file that declares the final marks of n students in all five courses.
